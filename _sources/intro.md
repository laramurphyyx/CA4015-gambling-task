# Iowa Gambling Task Assignment

## Why was the Iowa Gambling Task created?

The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) was created to study decision making. The original purpose of this paper was to investigate the decision making skills of a participant with damage to their ventromedial prefrontal cortex. [The original paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8039375/), written in 1994, showed that participants with damaged prefrontal cortices showed less awareness to the future consequences of their choices. There have been further variations of this study carried out in recent years, to focus on human responses not necessarily associated to brain function.

## How does the Iowa Gambling Task work?

The game involves a participant who has been given a loan of $2000 and is told to maximise their winnings. There are 4 cards, numbered 1 through 4, and each card has a corresponding reward value and a potential loss value. Participants have to choose a number of cards one-by-one, but they do not know what each card will yield in advance, each time they choose a card they are shown whether they have won and/or lost money. The winning/losing values assigned to each card are not random, there are certain stacks of cards that will yield higher, more stable return, whereas some stacks may be considered high risk, offering high winnings but high losses too. Some participants will notice this and begin to choose the long-term, higher yielding cards more regularly, while others continue to choose the high-risk cards.
This game used to be played with physical cards, but there are now virtual cards. A demo is available for the Iowa Gambling Task [here](https://www.psytoolkit.org/experiment-library/experiment_igt.html).

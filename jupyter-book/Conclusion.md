# Conclusion

## Data Exploration Conclusion

The exploration of these datasets relate to the payoff schemes and the general choices made by the subjects. 

The results from exploring the data based on the payoff schemes used by the studies was in line with the description of the payoff schemes in [this paper](https://openpsychologydata.metajnl.com/articles/10.5334/jopd.ak/). It is useful to visualise the payoff schemes to try and justify differences in subjects' choices.

The results from exploring the choice popularity was quite interesting, as the popularity of each choice seems to change throughout the duration of the trials. The good decks and bad decks begin with a small difference in rewards and losses, that gradually become more drastic. The popularity increasing/decreasing are representative of the decks that become better or worse as the trials go on.

## Clustering Conclusion

The two cluster graphs created are created to see if the choice of decks or the study can be identifed.

The first clustering algorithm was used to identify the deck chosen by a subject based on the net profit/loss they made and the amount of times they chose that deck. This yielded quite an accurate set of clusters that are similar to the original classes they belong to. The clusters identified the bad decks as deck 1 and 2, and the good decks as 3 and 4 (identical to the real datasets). 

The second clustering algorithm was used to identify the study that each participant belonged to depending on the profits and loss made by each subject in all of the trials. The results of this clustering technique were not very ipressive, as when compared to the original data, the clusters had correlation. This was due to the nature of the data. The profits and losses made by each subject was distributed in a specific way irrespective of the study they participated in.
